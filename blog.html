    <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Answer:DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.<br>
    => One of the main reasons for developing the DOM is to maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or development environment.</h4>
